   About the system
This system is a service platform for HR management. Login via username and password.

    Company
There will be one director of the company.
The director adds managers.
When you add managers, a link will be sent to their email address.
There should be a position called HR_MANAGER among the department heads.
The manager in this position adds other employees to the system. When employees register, a link will be sent to their email address as well.

    Staff
Employees enter a password on the system via a link to their email.
The email address of the employees was considered a unique username.
Staff will be provided with turnstiles.

    Task
The task is in three different states (new, in progress, completed)
The director can assign tasks to managers and employees, and managers can only assign tasks to employees.
For each task, enter the name of the task, a description of the task, the time when the task should be completed, and the employee is attached to this task.
A message will be sent to the email address of the employee to whom the task is attached.
However, these tasks should appear in the employee window of the system.
Upon completion of the task, the employee will mark the completion of the task and send a message to the manager or director who assigned the task.

    Turniket
A turnstile will be installed at the enterprise to determine the working hours of employees.
The turnstile will have entrances and exits.
Information on the time of entry or exit of the enterprise should be recorded on which side of the turnstile was scanned.

    Management
A list of employees is displayed for the Director and the HR_MANAGER manager.
If you want to see information about each employee, you need to get information about the employee's arrival and departure at intervals and the tasks performed.
Each employee is paid a certain monthly salary.
Once the employee is paid, it is recorded in the system.
It should be possible to see the salaries paid by the employee or by the month assigned.
Management should be able to see whether employees are performing their duties on time or not.
